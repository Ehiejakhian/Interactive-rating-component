## Meet Me
Good day. I'm Ehi. I'm an aspiring developer from Edo, Nigeria. I took this challenge. Here's how I did it and thanks for reading!

## My process
After my HTML, I start styling with padding. I set the margin of all elements to zero and then give all elements borders. This helps me visualize all element boundaries - all this I do without adding any color.

Then, I add color, backgrounds and border radii to the assigned elements. I prefer using Comic Sans MS or Comic Relief as my font during design because it feels relaxing to my eyes and it helps me think better. I can't explain it though, it's just a feeling.

Funny and weird, right?üòÅ

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was preety simple updating the DOM using pre-styled classed that are triggered by the JavaScript events and functions. Nothing new really.

### Continued development

I would love to be able to get  all the radio elements into an arry next time and listen to which of them is selected.
